## Make call

This feature is simulation of actual call making which stores histroy of the call along with it's duration.
When You enter 3 in main menu it will give two option one for Search by Name and other is Search by Contact No,When you choose one of them it will search for available match and shows all matching result you simply have to choose number you want to make call here in example only one contact is named as Kush Purohit to we choose 1,it will simulate calling precess and for ending call we have to enter e.
It will then shows histroy of that call,as in our directory.
